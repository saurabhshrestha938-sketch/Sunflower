          <b> <big> Supriya, I just love how much you adore sunflowers. The way you see their golden faces always turning toward the light feels like a reflection of your own spirit—bright, warm, and full of optimism. I admire how you find resilience and joy in them, as if they’re little reminders to stand tall and embrace life’s brightness even in tough times. Your love for those blooms makes me see them differently too, not just as flowers, but as symbols of the beauty you carry in your heart.</b><br>

        <p2><b>Sunflowers possess a radiant aesthetic beauty that feels both simple and majestic. Their towering green stems rise proudly from the earth, crowned with golden blooms that resemble miniature suns. Each petal curves outward like a ray of light, creating a perfect harmony between symmetry and vibrancy. The deep brown or black center contrasts strikingly with the bright yellow petals, giving the flower a bold yet balanced appearance. When seen in vast fields, sunflowers create a breathtaking sea of gold that sways gently with the breeze, evoking feelings of joy, warmth, and serenity. Their natural tendency to turn toward the sun adds a poetic charm, as if they are always reaching for light, embodying hope and positivity in their graceful form.</b></big><br>
